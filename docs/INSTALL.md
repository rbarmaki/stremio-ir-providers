# How to Install the "Iran Provider" Stremio Addon (Web & Android)


## Introduction

Stremio is a media center application that allows you to organize and watch video content from various sources. Addons extend Stremio's functionality. This guide specifically explains how to install the **"Iran Provider"** addon, which helps find content sources within Stremio.

You can install **"Iran Provider"** in two main ways:
1.  By searching for it directly within the Stremio Community Addons list.
2.  By pasting its specific installation link (Manifest URL).

Both methods achieve the same result. We will cover both for the Stremio Web version and the Stremio Android app.

**Addon Details:**
* **Name:** Iran Provider
* **Manifest URL:** `https://sip.m17i.xyz/manifest.json`

## Prerequisites

1.  **Stremio Account:** You need a registered Stremio account.
2.  **Stremio Application:**

## Installing "Iran Provider" on Stremio Android

Addons sync across your account, so installing on Web often adds it to Android automatically. However, here's how to install it directly from the Android app:

1.  **Open Stremio App:** Launch the Stremio application on your Android device.
2.  **Log In:** Ensure you are logged into your Stremio account.
3.  **Go to Addons:** Look at the **bottom navigation bar** of the app. Tap the **puzzle piece icon (🧩)**, typically labeled **"Addons"**.
4.  **Choose Installation Method:**
    * **Method A (Search - Recommended First Try):**
        * Once in the Addons section, use the **search bar** (often at the top).
        * Ensure you are viewing "Community" addons (you might need to tap a filter option and select Community).
        * Type `Iran Provider` and search.
        * Locate **"Iran Provider"** in the search results.
    * **Method B (Manifest URL - Guaranteed):**
        * Within the Addons section, look for an option to install via URL. This might be behind a menu icon (like three dots ⋮) or a button (e.g., a '+' icon, or text like "Install from URL").
        * Tap that option, and when prompted to enter the URL, paste the exact following link:
            ```
            https://sip.m17i.xyz/manifest.json
            ```
        * Confirm or submit the URL. **"Iran Provider"** should appear.
5.  **Install:** Whether you found it via search (Method A) or URL (Method B), tap the **"Install"** button next to **"Iran Provider"**.

## Verification and Seeing Results

1.  **Check Installation:** Go back to the **Addons** section (🧩) and look under "Installed Addons" or "My Addons". **"Iran Provider"** should now be listed. (Allow a minute for syncing if needed).

2.  **Search for Content:** The main way to see results from **"Iran Provider"** is by searching:
    * Go to the **Search** section in Stremio (magnifying glass icon 🔍).
    * Type the name of a movie or TV series.
    * Select the title from the search results to open its details page.

3.  **Find Sources/Links:** On the details page, scroll to find the **Sources** or **Links** section.
    * Results provided by the **"Iran Provider"** addon will appear here, often identified by its name.
    * Click on a link from **"Iran Provider"** to attempt streaming.

**Important:** **"Iran Provider"** will only show results if it finds sources for the specific movie/series you search for. Not every title will have a result from this addon.

## Important Notes & Troubleshooting

* **No Results Showing?** After confirming installation, try searching for a few different titles. If still no results appear specifically from "Iran Provider", the addon itself might be temporarily down, or it may not have sources for the content you're looking for. Check the source/community where you found the addon for status updates.
* **URL Not Working During Install?** Double-check you pasted `https://sip.m17i.xyz/manifest.json` exactly right, with no extra spaces. If it fails, the URL might be temporarily offline. Try the search method instead, or check with the addon source.
* **Syncing:** Remember, addons sync with your account.
* **Community Addons:** "Iran Provider" is a community addon. Install and use it at your own discretion. Stremio is not responsible for third-party addons.
